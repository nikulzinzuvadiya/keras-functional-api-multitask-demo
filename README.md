# keras-functional-api-multitask-demo

This repository demonstrates multitask learning using Keras Functional API. The model performs two simultaneous tasks:

1.Regression Task: Predicting a continuous value using a linear activation function.
2.Binary Classification Task: Predicting a binary label using a sigmoid activation function.

The Keras Functional API enables the creation of complex architectures with shared layers for multitask learning.This code highlights:

Using shared hidden layers to extract features for multiple tasks.
Outputting multiple predictions (regression and classification) from a single model.
Visualizing the model's architecture using plot_model.
